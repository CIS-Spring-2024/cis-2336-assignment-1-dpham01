        <h3>Who Am I</h3>
        <p>My name is <strong>Dylan Pham.</strong>I am a student tasked with the responsibility of creating an informative and usefule webstie for UH. originally from Houston but raised in the lively city of San Francisco. Currently, I serve as a Golf Assistance Associate at Westwood Golf Club, where I'm privileged to blend my love for the game with my passion for hospitality. Family and friends hold a special place in my heart, and I find joy in nurturing these connections. Beyond the golf course, I'm deeply immersed in the worlds of music, movies, and food â€“ each providing endless inspiration and enjoyment in my life. I cherish the opportunity to create memorable experiences and foster a sense of community, where every day brings new adventures on and off the fairway.</p>
